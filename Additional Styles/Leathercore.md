  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a hybrid leather-and-fabric style. The subject should look as if it is constructed from stitched panels, with around half of the surface made from leather and the other half made from rustic fabrics such as denim, plaid cloth, cotton, or canvas. The leather sections should include smooth polished areas and panels with patina and subtle wear, while the fabric sections should bring varied colors and textures for contrast. All seams and stitching should be neat, precise, and visible, emphasizing the handcrafted look. The overall design should feel premium, tactile, and visually rich, combining the warmth of leather with the variety of rustic textiles. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the patchwork-constructed subject.",
