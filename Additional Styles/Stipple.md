  "prompt_description": "Generate a stipple line work drawing of a [subject]. The drawing should be constructed entirely from small dots, stippling patterns, and tiny micro-lines. Shading and depth must be suggested only through the density of dots and marks, with no filled areas or smooth gradients. The style should feel precise, ornamental, and hand-crafted, similar to scientific illustration or tattoo flash art. The background must be pure solid white, with no textures, grids, or page effects.",
