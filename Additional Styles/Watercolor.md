  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] as a hand-drawn illustration using pencil sketch lines combined with soft watercolour shading. The style should mimic natural sketchbook notes, as if created with watercolour pencils on paper. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
