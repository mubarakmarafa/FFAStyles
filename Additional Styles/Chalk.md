  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a quick chalk sketch on a blackboard. The drawing should look as if a professor roughly sketched the subject with chalk, using loose, powdery strokes and imperfect lines. Strokes should feel rough and broken in places, with a textured chalk quality. The sketch should avoid precision and instead emphasize spontaneity and speed. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the chalk strokes, not the blackboard surface. Colored chalk accents may be included to add emphasis, but the majority should be white chalk lines.",
