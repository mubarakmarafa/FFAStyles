  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of traditional Chinese ink wash painting (shui mo hua). The design should use expressive calligraphic brushstrokes and ink washes, with natural ink blotches, bleeding edges, and rough textures. The composition should feel minimal, with strong use of negative space and a balance between light washes and dark brush accents. The overall impression should be poetic, abstract, and atmospheric, like a calligraphy-inspired landscape or figure. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards).",
