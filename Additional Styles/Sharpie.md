  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a bold Sharpie doodle. The drawing should use extremely thick, heavy black lines with a wobbly, hand-drawn quality. Lines may overshoot, leave gaps, or feel incomplete, giving the doodle a casual and raw appearance. The subject should be drawn with as few strokes as possible, keeping the design minimal and recognizable. No shading, color, or fills should be used â€” only bold black lines. The background must be pure solid white, with no textures or page effects.",
