  "prompt_description": "Generate a loose gesture line drawing of a [subject], in the style of fast figure-drawing sketches. The drawing should use quick, energetic strokes that overlap and suggest motion and form, without precise outlines. The result should feel spontaneous and expressive, as if drawn rapidly to capture the subjectâ€™s energy. Avoid shading, coloring, or filled areas. The background must be pure solid white, with no textures, grids, or page effects.",
