  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] as a loose technical sketch in the style of an architect or industrial designer. The drawing should feature exploratory overlapping pen strokes, lines that overshoot, and areas where multiple light sketch lines resolve into one clean confirmed line. Use semi-transparent marker-style shading (like copic markers) to add tone and depth. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
