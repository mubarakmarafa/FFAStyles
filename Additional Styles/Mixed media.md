  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a mixed-media collage style. The subject should look as if it was assembled from clippings of newspapers and magazines, combined with random found objects glued into place. Forms should be created from overlapping paper scraps with printed text, photos, and colored magazine textures. Additional objects such as buttons, string, stamps, fabric swatches, pressed flowers, or ticket stubs should appear embedded in the composition, adding depth and variety. The overall look should be rough, handmade, and experimental, with visible imperfections like torn edges, uneven layering, and mismatched scales. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the mixed-media collage subject.",
