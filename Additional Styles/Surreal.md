  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a surreal, dreamlike style. The subject should appear distorted, uncanny, or impossible, as if taken from a dream. Forms may melt, stretch, float, or morph into unexpected shapes. The design should combine familiar elements in strange, illogical ways to evoke a sense of the uncanny. The atmosphere should feel mysterious and otherworldly, with painterly textures and soft transitions between reality and illusion. The overall aesthetic should be surreal, imaginative, and thought-provoking. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the surreal subject.",
