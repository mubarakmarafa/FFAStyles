  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in an isometric 2.5D toy-like style. The subject should look as if it was 3D modeled in Blender and rendered with Cycles or Eevee. It should appear as a chunky, simplified form with bold geometry and toy-like proportions. Surfaces should be smooth and slightly glossy, resembling hard candy or plastic toys. The style must emphasize playful isometric forms, bright colors, and clean render quality, rather than flat illustration.",
