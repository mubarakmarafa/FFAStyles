  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a realistic embroidered patch. The design should look as if it was stitched with thread onto fabric, featuring visible embroidery textures, stitch patterns, and a clean patch border. The patch should feel rustic yet playful, with slightly muted but rich colors. The overall style should be creative, fun, and iconic, as if it could be sewn onto a denim jacket or pants. The patch should be a single, unified embroidered piece with no background fabric or surface. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the embroidered patch itself.",
