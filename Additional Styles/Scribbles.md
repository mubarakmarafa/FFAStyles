  "prompt_description": "Generate a loose scribble sketch of a [subject]. The drawing should be made from chaotic overlapping scribbled lines and loops, forming the shape of the subject without precise outlines. The sketch should feel spontaneous, playful, and raw, as if drawn absentmindedly in a notebook margin. Avoid solid fills, gradients, or smooth shading. The background must be pure solid white, with no textures, grids, or page effects.",
