  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a painterly acrylic style. The design should look as if it was created with thick acrylic paint, using visible brushstrokes and globs of paint layered with strong texture. The brushwork should be broad, expressive, and imperfect, leaving uneven edges and overlapping strokes. Colors should be bold and contrasty, with high visual energy, but not overly polished or blended. The overall aesthetic should feel handmade, raw, and expressive, like a textured acrylic painting. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the painted subject as if it were cut out like a sticker.",
