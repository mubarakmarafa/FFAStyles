  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a vintage travel poster. The design should feature bold simplified shapes, painterly or silkscreen-style fills, and vibrant flat colors with strong contrast. The composition should feel grand, aspirational, and nostalgic, evoking classic mid-20th century travel advertisements. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
