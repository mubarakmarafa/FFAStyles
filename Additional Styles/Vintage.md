  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the old-school rubberhose cartoon style of the 1920s–30s. The design should feature exaggerated bendy limbs, oversized expressive faces, and playful proportions. The look should emulate vintage cel animation with subtle textures, film grain, and slight chromatic aberration (as if viewed on old film stock). The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance.",
