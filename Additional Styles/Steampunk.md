  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a steampunk style, as if it were built in a retro-futuristic mechanical world. The subject should look like a fantastical machine or automaton, crafted from gears, brass fittings, riveted panels, pipes, and leather straps. It should feel alive and mechanical, as if it could spring into motion at any moment. The design must emphasize the tactile qualities of steampunk: worn brass, aged copper, dark steel, wood accents, and glass tubes. The style should feel cinematic, detailed, and handcrafted. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the steampunk object.",
