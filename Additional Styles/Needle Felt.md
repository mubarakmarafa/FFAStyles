  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a handmade needle felt craft object. The design should feature soft, fuzzy wool textures with visible fibers, rounded shapes, and slightly imperfect hand-crafted proportions. The subject should appear like a cute wool sculpture, playful and tactile, as if made by felting colored wool. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
