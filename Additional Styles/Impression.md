  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of an impressionist painting. The subject should be depicted with short, quick, and visible brushstrokes that suggest form without precise outlines. The painting should emphasize light, atmosphere, and color over strict detail, using layers of broken strokes to create a sense of movement and vibrancy. Colors should appear optically mixed, with warm and cool tones layered side by side to create depth and variation. The overall aesthetic should feel lively, painterly, and atmospheric, as if capturing a fleeting moment in time. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the impressionistic subject.",
