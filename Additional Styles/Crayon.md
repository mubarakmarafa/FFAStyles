  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of Cray-Pas oil pastels. The design should feature thick, waxy strokes with visible texture, vibrant colour layering, and expressive hand-drawn marks. The illustration should feel playful, handmade, and slightly messy, as if drawn directly with pastels on paper. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
