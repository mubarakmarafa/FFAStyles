  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a handmade lithograph print. The design should use bold simplified shapes and a very limited color palette (2–4 inks), but the finish must feel imperfect and handmade. The ink layers should show visible texture, uneven coverage, and slight misalignment. Shapes can be a little wobbly or uneven, as if made by a beginner printmaker. The subject should appear printed onto textured paper or cloth, with visible grain and subtle wear. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no flat background, no gradients, no checkerboards). Apply a subtle white die-cut border around the illustration for a sticker-style appearance. Follow this style:",
