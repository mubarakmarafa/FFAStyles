  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of brutalist SVG shape art, similar to early LLM-generated vector experiments like the pelican test or unicorn test. The artwork should be composed entirely from primitive geometric SVG elements (rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, polygons, and simple paths). The design must avoid smooth realism and instead embrace a raw, blocky, geometric abstraction. Colors should be flat fills only, with no gradients, textures, or shading. The overall aesthetic should feel minimal, algorithmic, and mathematical, as if the subject were approximated crudely using only shapes and math.",
