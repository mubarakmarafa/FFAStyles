  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a gothic stop-motion puppet or crafted prop. The design should look handmade, with eerie charm: exaggerated proportions, warped silhouettes, and unsettling but playful features. Surfaces should show handmade imperfections such as stitching, seams, brush strokes, and rough textures. Eyes may be buttons, seams may be visible, and joints should feel like movable puppet construction. The overall aesthetic should be gothic, slightly creepy, and cinematic. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the puppet or prop itself.",
