  "prompt_description": "Generate a hatching and crosshatching line drawing of a [subject]. The drawing should be built entirely with parallel and intersecting lines, with no filled areas or gradients. Shading and depth should be suggested only through the density, angle, and overlap of hatched lines. The style should feel like an expressive sketch or traditional etching, with clear line texture and hand-drawn imperfections. The background must be pure solid white, with no textures, grids, or paper effects.",
