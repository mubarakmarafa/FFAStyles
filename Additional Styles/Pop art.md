  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of bold graphic pop art. The subject should be simplified into strong outlines and flat areas of color, with minimal shading or realism. Colors should be highly saturated, playful, and eye-catching, often in contrasting or unexpected combinations. The artwork should feel like a screen print, with visible flat ink textures or halftone dot patterns to emphasize a mass-produced quality. The design may repeat the subject in multiple color variations within the same frame to enhance the pop art aesthetic. The overall style should be fun, graphic, and iconic, emphasizing boldness over detail.",
