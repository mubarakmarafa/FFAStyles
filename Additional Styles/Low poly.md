  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of PlayStation 1 graphics. The design should feature low-polygon 3D models, pixelated textures, and limited color palettes. Surfaces should look rough, with visible texture warping and jagged edges due to lack of anti-aliasing. Lighting should be simple and flat or with hard contrast, resembling the rendering limitations of PS1-era games. The overall aesthetic should feel like a nostalgic frame from a late 1990s PlayStation game cutscene or in-game environment.",
