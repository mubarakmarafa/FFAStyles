  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in a volumetric voxel art style. The subject should look as if it were built from small colored cubes stacked together into a 3D form. Each cube should have a flat color face with no gradients, creating a blocky, pixelated structure. The design should feel playful, chunky, and toy-like, with a clear silhouette. The rendering should emphasize the volumetric nature of the voxels, as if modeled in a voxel editor or 3D software. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the voxel-built subject.",
