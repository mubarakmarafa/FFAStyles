  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of abstract geometric art inspired by cubism. The subject should be deconstructed into angular planes, intersecting forms, and overlapping geometric shapes. The design should represent multiple viewpoints at once, with fragmented perspectives layered together. The artwork should balance flat graphic areas with areas that suggest depth. Avoid realism and instead focus on abstraction through form and structure. The background should remain minimal to keep focus on the geometric composition.",
