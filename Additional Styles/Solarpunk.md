  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of solarpunk design. The subject should feel optimistic, clean, and futuristic, with design elements that integrate technology and nature. The aesthetic should feature smooth organic shapes, bright solar-inspired motifs, and eco-friendly details such as solar panels, greenery, glass structures, and flowing natural forms. Materials should include glass, polished metal, white ceramic, natural wood, and vibrant plants. The style should feel airy, hopeful, and new, as if it belongs to a sustainable future. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the solarpunk object.",
