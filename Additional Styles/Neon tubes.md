  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of old-school neon signage. The subject should look as if it is built entirely from glowing neon glass tubes, bent into shape and connected with subtle brackets or joints. The design should emphasize the bright, luminous quality of neon, with glowing edges and subtle bloom around the tubes. The look should feel retro yet futuristic, inspired by the aesthetic of vintage neon signs. The output must be a transparent alpha PNG (no solid background, no checkerboards), showing only the neon-tube constructed subject.",
