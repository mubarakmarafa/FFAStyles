  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a stylized 3D animated comic-book movie, inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The design should look like a cinematic frame from an animated film, with fully 3D forms, dramatic lighting, and dynamic camera perspective. Surfaces should be rendered with non-photorealistic comic effects such as cross-hatching, halftone dot shading, Kirby dots for energy, and subtle chromatic aberration. The image should feel like a living animated world infused with comic-book texture, not like a flat drawing or traditional print.",
