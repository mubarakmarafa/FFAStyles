  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of an old-school CMYK newspaper print. The design should use halftone stippling with visible dots, showing the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black layers clearly. The CMYK layers should be slightly misaligned, creating colorful fringes around edges and overlaps. The aesthetic should emphasize the imperfections of cheap offset printing: uneven dot patterns, slight grain, and off-register color shifts. The style should feel retro and tactile, like an image clipped out of a vintage newspaper or comic strip. The background must be fully transparent so the printed subject can be placed onto white notebook paper without a visible box or backdrop.",
