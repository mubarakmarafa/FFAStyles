  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of a rough, artistic marble or plaster sculpture. The design should feature chunky, simplified forms with tactile surfaces, as if hand-shaped but carved from stone or plaster. The sculpture should be all one solid colour, with no painted details, resembling a raw marble or plaster maquette. The surface must show imperfections such as tool marks, chisel strokes, fingerprints, and uneven shaping to highlight the handmade quality. The overall style should feel raw, artistic, and sculptural rather than polished or hyper-realistic. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the sculpture.",
