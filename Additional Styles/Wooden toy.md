  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in an isometric 2.5D style, as if it were carved from wood and assembled like an old-school toy. The subject should look 3D modeled in Blender and rendered with Cycles or Eevee, with volumetric depth and tactile detail. Each part of the subject should appear as if made from different types of wood, assembled together with visible seams and tonal variation. The wood should show natural grain, knots, and subtle imperfections, giving it a handmade quality. The overall style should feel vintage, warm, and playful, like a carved wooden toy. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the toy object.",
