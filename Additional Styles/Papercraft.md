  "prompt_description": "Generate a [subject] in the style of handmade cardboard and paper cutout art. The design should look like it was assembled from rough paper shapes cut with scissors and layered together. The edges should feel imperfect and uneven, with visible cut marks, overlaps, and gaps. Paper textures should be clearly visible, such as fibrous construction paper, cardboard ridges, or craft paper surfaces. The style should feel playful and handmade, like a middle school art project, rather than clean or polished digital work. The background must be fully transparent, showing only the paper cutout subject.",
